# Hermes Office

This fork is planning Pokémon World. See the
[product and technical handoff draft](docs/handoff/pokemon-world-specification.md)
for accepted decisions, source-recovery gaps, and implementation prerequisites.
The plugin described below is still the inherited Office runtime.

A Desktop plugin. One floor of desks, one desk per Bot Mode agent.

Uses the same live data Bot Mode already uses:

- `profiles.list` for the roster
- `ui_meta.hermes-bots` for names and avatars
- `host.onEvent` plus session IDs for Office task progress and completion
- `host.state.busy` for the focused chat's separate live-turn indicator
- `host.requestProfile` for owner-routed background work
- `host.openSession` / `prompt.submit` into that bot's Bot Chat session

While a bot is working, their monitor lights up and their face rocks.

Give them a task from the bar at the bottom. It goes into the same forever **Bot Chat** Bot Mode already uses, so the history stays one conversation. Click a nameplate to pick who gets it. Double-click, or hit **open chat**, to jump into that same session. Office tracks each accepted task by bot and session; failures keep the prompt for an explicit retry, while an unconfirmed result stays marked unknown instead of being counted as finished.

Cute bits on the floor:

- First open shows one hint that points at the task bar: give someone something small. When the first result comes back a second hint shows up: pet them, try a game. Close either, or just do the thing, and they never come back. Faces and hop squares have tooltips too.
- They blink, breathe, and their eyes follow your mouse when it comes close. Each bot blinks on its own clock (some double blink), idle eyes drift and glance to the side now and then, and mood changes slide in instead of popping. Thinking bots turn their eyes with the rock of their head. Losing musical chairs or missing the pizza gets a sad face. Hover a face and they flinch. Tap to pet. Hold still and they fall asleep in your hand.
- Drag them around. They land with a squash and a puff of dust, then keep wandering. Drop two close together and they whisper. Two bots crossing paths say hi.
- **Back to desk** is the only thing that sends them home. Every desk has an office chair. It wobbles while they are away.
- Click the carpet and everyone peeks.
- The garden sky has a sun by day and a moon by night that cross the wall through the day. The office and loft have a window that shows the same sky. After 7pm the room goes night and desk lamps warm up. Bots left alone at their desks start to yawn, and after a few quiet minutes they nod off. A task or a pet wakes them.
- The plant leans when someone thinks. The clock ticks in 24 hour time. Click it to flip digital and analog. Drag it to move.
- Cycle the room from the header: carpet, loft, garden, nightclub, or pizza parlor. Each one is a flat wall band and a tiled floor (tiny SVGs, no perspective) so the paper dolls and desks actually stand on it. Night still dims whatever is on.
- Sending a task pops a "?" over the bot, flies a paper plane to the desk, and the monitor boots up. Finishing pops a "!". The screen types out while they think. When they finish, confetti pops over the desk, a little note lands on the desk and stays until you open the chat (the header says who has news, click it to jump there), they earn a star on their nameplate (stars are also written to the bot profile, so they follow the bot, not the machine), and they walk to the bar. Two at the bar high five.
- Desks sit across from a bar with bottles, taps and a pint. Finish a task and they walk over, sit on a stool, linger, and cheer.
- In the pizza parlor the bar is a pizza counter with one pie per round. A round starts whenever anyone gets a task. First bot to finish and reach the counter takes a slice and carries it around for a bit. Everyone after that gets "no pizza".
- Hopscotch is chalked on the floor in the aisle. Tap a square and an idle bot hops the course out and back, landing on both squares of a pair, with the chalk lighting up under them.
- **chairs** in the header starts musical chairs. Wooden chairs appear in the middle of the floor, music notes float up, and idle bots circle them. When the music stops everyone freezes for a beat, then races in. One is left standing. Bots at their desks watch and clap. Thinking bots keep working.
- Each room has one small living thing: butterflies in the garden, a light sweep in the nightclub, a wood oven in the parlor, a bubbling water cooler in the office, a swaying pendant lamp in the loft. A tally board on the wall counts tasks finished.
- A bot with no task for two days gets bored: chin on the desk, half closed eyes, doodling on the screen. A task fixes it.
- The header names who is working on an Office task (Scout working, Scout, Arke +2 working). Click it to scroll to that desk. Work in the focused chat outside Office is labeled separately and never awards Office trophies.
- Steady labels like here, at desk, exploring fade out after a moment so a busy floor stays calm. Hover a bot to see them again. Thinking, bored, zzz, games and results stay.
- On the hour, idle bots at their desks look up and take a short break. If you missed it, click the clock within ten minutes of the hour and they do it again.
- Employee of the month. A gold framed portrait on the wall of the bot with the most finished tasks this month, with a brass plate and their name. Ties keep the current holder, you have to pass them. Resets on the first.
- The header shows a weekly recap once anything has happened: tasks done, who ate the most pizza, hops taken. Resets on Monday.
- Keyboard: with a bot picked, arrows nudge it around the floor (Shift for bigger steps), Enter opens its chat, P pets it.
- The room is a centred diorama with a fixed play height. It scrolls only when there are more desks than fit.
- Opening a chat no longer sends a starter message on your behalf. The first real task fills the bubble.
- If your OS asks for reduced motion, the bobbing and bouncing turn off. Walks stay.

## Install

This is a desktop plugin. Put it on the machine that runs Hermes Desktop.

```
copy this folder to:

  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\hermes\desktop-plugins\hermes-office
```

The folder name must be `hermes-office`. Then Ctrl+K → Reload desktop plugins.

Use a current Desktop build with owner-routed `host.requestProfile`, `host.onEvent`, and `host.openSession`. Older builds can still load the floor, but Office fails closed when it cannot prove which profile owns a background request.

Bot Mode does not have to be on, but avatars look right when Bot Mode has already saved looks on the profile.

## Open it

Sidebar → Office, or ⌘K / Ctrl+K → Open office floor.
